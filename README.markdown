## repeated-code-finder

### What?

Run a file through this code to see where you have repeating chunks; maybe you can factor them out and make your code shinier!

### How?
If you don't have [terminaltables](//github.com/Robpol86/terminaltables) installed, do that:

`pip install terminaltables`
(or, `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

Then, run any file you like through the program:
`$ python repeated_code_finder.py [path to file]`
